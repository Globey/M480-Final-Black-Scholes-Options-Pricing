M480-Final-Black-Scholes-Options-Pricing
========================================

**Description:** <br>
I trade options in my spare time so I decided to implement the Black-Scholes equation in python (although as of now we're using cython) and go through the peer-review process to get my code in Sage. I've written a brief paper with basic information about Black-Scholes. I've also created <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14671">Trac ticket #14671</a>, which is an ongoing process. 

I've uploaded the two patches that I've created so far for the Trac ticket, as well as the .pyx file containing the cython code. For more information follow the link to the trac ticket and read the paper.
