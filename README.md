M480-Final-Black-Scholes-Options-Pricing
========================================

**Description:** <br>
I trade options in my spare time so I decided to implement the Black-Scholes equation in python (although as of now we're using cython) and go through the peer-review process to get my code in Sage. I've written a brief paper with basic information about Black-Scholes. I've also created Trac ticket <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14671">#14671</a>, which is an ongoing process. I've included the two patches that I've created so far for the Trac ticket. For more information click the link and read the paper.
